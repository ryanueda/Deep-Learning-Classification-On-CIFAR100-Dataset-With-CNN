# Deep-Learning-Classification-On-CIFAR100-Dataset-With-CNN
Usage Of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) To Produce Deep Learning Models For CIFAR100 Classification

## Dataset
CIFAR100 is a dataset consisting of 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).

## About The Project
The project aims to make use of multiple Deep Learning techniques to create a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images from the CIFAR100 dataset.

This includes and is not limited to:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing & Wrangling
- Data Augmentation
- Model Architechture
- Model Visualisation
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Errors
